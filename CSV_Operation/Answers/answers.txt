1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
	1) Upload the CSV file via the API.
	2) Process each row to detect formulas or direct values.
	3) Evaluate formulas using Apache POI's formula evaluation engine.
	4) Write the output (calculated values) to a new CSV file.


2. What type of errors would you check for?












3. How might a user break your code?
Circular Formulas:
	If the user provides formulas that reference each other, it could lead to infinite loops during evaluation (e.g., A1 = B1 + 2 and B1 = A1 + 1). The current code does not account for circular reference detection, which could crash the system or hang indefinitely.

Invalid CSV Format:
	The user might upload a CSV file that doesnâ€™t conform to the expected format (e.g., missing columns, rows with uneven data). This could result in array out-of-bounds errors or other issues during processing.
An empty or incorrectly formatted CSV could also cause issues during reading or writing operations.
