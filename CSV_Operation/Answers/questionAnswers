1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
	1)File Reading: 
		Use MultipartFile's input stream with CSVReader and ByteArrayOutputStream.
	2)Data Processing: 
		Evaluate formulas and update cell values dynamically.
	3)Output Generation: 
		Write processed CSV to ByteArrayOutputStream.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
	1)File Errors: 
		Validate file type and handle read issues.
	2)Parsing Errors: 
		Manage invalid formulas and cell references.
	3)Calculation Errors: 
		Prevent division by zero and handle format issues.
	4)Output Errors: 
		Handle CSV writing exceptions.

3. How might a user break your code?
	1)Invalid File Types: 
		Validate file extension and MIME type.
	2)Malformed CSV Data: 
		Check for parsing errors and data consistency.
	3)Complex Formulas: 
		Limit formula complexity and provide error messages.
	4)Large Files: 
		Set file size limits and optimize processing.
